It is easier than ever before to create a personal website today thanks to services like [google sites](https://sites.google.com/new?tgif=d), [squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), and [wix](https://www.wix.com/). However, these building a site using one of these platforms can feel repetetive and uninspiring, as countless other users are following the same templates to generate their sites. Alternatively, if you're interested in creating a more unique site you can tinker with and control more of, I'll teach you how to create a site like [mine](www.londonchamberlain.com) with little coding experience:

  <summary><b>Static Sites That Inspire Me</b><br>
  <i>Take a look at the code nested in these sites if you like a particular feature!</i>

    <ul>
      <li>Check out Giulio Schinaia's <a href="https://gschinaia.github.io/">academic site</a>. I especially like Giulio's use of the light/dark toggle button.</li>
      <li>Rob Williams' <a href="https://jayrobwilliams.com/">academic site</a> boasts a wealth of static site knowledge for you to dig through. I've implemented so many aspects of Rob's site in my own using his commit history, as well as his posts. Rob's own <a href="https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/">post</a> about creating an academic site was the inspiration for this post. Sorry for the theft, Rob.</li>
      <li>Antoine Soetewey's <a href="https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/4740">personal site</a> is elite. His R blog and use of an English/French language toggle are both super fascinating to check out.</li>
