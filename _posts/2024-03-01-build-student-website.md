It is easier than ever before to create a personal website thanks to services like [google sites](https://sites.google.com/new?tgif=d), [squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), and [wix](https://www.wix.com/). However, building a site using one of these platforms can often feel repetetive and uninspiring, as countless other users are following the same templates to generate their sites. 

Alternatively, if you're interested in creating a more unique student site you can tinker with and control more of, I'll teach you how to create a site like [this one](www.londonchamberlain.com) with little coding experience:

# Why Build a Student Website?

Creating a personal website can be a game-changer for students, offering a dynamic platform to showcase achievements, skills, and passions. It's not just about impressing others; it's about crafting a unique online identity that sets you apart in a competitive world. Through your website, you can paint a vivid picture of who you are, what you've accomplished, and where you're headed, leaving a lasting impression on users. Plus, building and maintaining a website isn't just about the end product; it's a learning journey that hones valuable digital skills like web design, coding, and SEOâ€”skills that are increasingly useful today. Your website isn't just a one-time project; it's a long-term investment in yourself.

# How to Build a Student Site

Now that we know why you should build a site of your own, how can we actually do it? Although there are many approaches a student can take to launch their own personal website, this guide is going to focus on developing an Academic Pages static site using Github to store and deploy the code, and Porkbun (optional) to attach a custom domain.

## Using GitHub

If you don't already have a GitHub account, no worries. It's easy to sign up.

1. First, Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Click Sign up.
3. Follow the prompts to create your personal account.

During sign up, you'll be asked to verify your email address. Without a verified email address, you won't be able to complete some basic GitHub tasks, such as creating a repository.

If you're having problems verifying your email address, there are some troubleshooting steps you can take. For more information, see "[Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address#troubleshooting-email-verification)."

### Forking Repositories

Once we're signed up for GitHub, we'll want to fork a respository. The site we'll be creating in this tutorial uses the repository, Academic Pages, as the foundation for our site. We'll fork this to get started. 

If you've never forked a repository before, don't worry. We'll walk through how to fork the Academic Pages repository below:

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the [academicpages/academicpages.github.io](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) repository.

2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

Insert image of forking here. Alt caption: Screenshot of the main page of repository. A button, labeled with a fork icon and "Fork 59.3k," is outlined in dark orange.

3. Under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repository.

4. By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.

5. Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.

6. Optionally, select Copy the DEFAULT branch only.

For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. If you do not select this option, all branches will be copied into the new fork.

7. Click Create fork.

### Accessing Repository via Local Computer (optional)

#### Syncing Cloned Repository to GitHub (optional)

Once your site is forked to your very own repository, you'll want to deploy it for the world to see! Don't worry, you can come back after to make more changes.

### Deploying Site

## Customizing Your Site

### Making Changes Locally

Tip: Make small changes one-by-one and test the effects. Making multiple commits and alterations often ends up with unexpected results where developers don't know where the issues lie.

### Pushing Changes to Web

## Using Custom Web Domain

### Purchasing a Domain

### Connecting Domain to Static Site

## Moving Forward & Resources

      <li>Check out Giulio Schinaia's <a href="https://gschinaia.github.io/">academic site</a>. I especially like Giulio's use of the light/dark toggle button.</li>
      <li>Rob Williams' <a href="https://jayrobwilliams.com/">academic site</a> boasts a wealth of static site knowledge for you to dig through. I've implemented so many aspects of Rob's site in my own using his commit history, as well as his posts. Rob's own <a href="https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/">post</a> about creating an academic site was the inspiration for this post. Sorry for the theft, Rob.</li>
      <li>Antoine Soetewey's <a href="https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/4740">personal site</a> is elite. His R blog and use of an English/French language toggle are both super fascinating to check out.</li>
