It is easier than ever before to create a personal website thanks to services like [google sites](https://sites.google.com/new?tgif=d), [squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), and [wix](https://www.wix.com/). However, building a site using one of these platforms can often feel repetetive and uninspiring, as countless other users are following the same templates to generate their sites. 

Alternatively, if you're interested in creating a more unique student site you can tinker with and control more of, I'll teach you how to create a site like [this one](www.londonchamberlain.com) with little coding experience:

# Why Should I Build a Student Website?

Creating a personal website can be a game-changer for students, offering a dynamic platform to showcase achievements, skills, and passions. It's not just about impressing others; it's about crafting a unique online identity that sets you apart in a competitive world. Through your website, you can paint a vivid picture of who you are, what you've accomplished, and where you're headed, leaving a lasting impression on users. Plus, building and maintaining a website isn't just about the end product; it's a learning journey that hones valuable digital skills like web design, coding, and SEOâ€”skills that are increasingly useful today. Your website isn't just a one-time project; it's a long-term investment in yourself.

# How to Build a Static Site

Now that we know why you should build a site of your own, how can we actually do it? Although there are many approaches a student can take to launch their own personal website, this guide is going to focus on developing an Academic Pages static site using Github to store and deploy the code, and Porkbun (optional) to attach a custom domain.

## Using Github

Register account.

### Forking Repositories

Once your site is forked to your very own repository, you'll want to deploy it for the world to see! Don't worry, you can come back after to make more changes.

### Deploying Site

Settings > Pages > Deploy from Master Branch

## Customizing Your Site

### Making Changes Locally

Tip: Make small changes one-by-one and test the effects. Making multiple commits and alterations often ends up with unexpected results where developers don't know where the issues lie.

### Pushing Changes to Web

## Using Custom Web Domain

### Purchasing a Domain

### Connecting Domain to Static Site

      <li>Check out Giulio Schinaia's <a href="https://gschinaia.github.io/">academic site</a>. I especially like Giulio's use of the light/dark toggle button.</li>
      <li>Rob Williams' <a href="https://jayrobwilliams.com/">academic site</a> boasts a wealth of static site knowledge for you to dig through. I've implemented so many aspects of Rob's site in my own using his commit history, as well as his posts. Rob's own <a href="https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/">post</a> about creating an academic site was the inspiration for this post. Sorry for the theft, Rob.</li>
      <li>Antoine Soetewey's <a href="https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/4740">personal site</a> is elite. His R blog and use of an English/French language toggle are both super fascinating to check out.</li>
