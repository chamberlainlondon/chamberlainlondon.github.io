Howdy, my name is London Chamberlain. I'm a current undergraduate at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), majoring in Economics with applications in Computer Science and Finance. 

Today, I specialize in creating interactive financial models and [dashboards](https://chamberlainlondon.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/) for businesses using tools such as Microsoft Excel with VBA, Power BI, and Python. Additionally, I have practical experience with SQL, R, and Tableau, having applied these skills in various academic projects.

Beyond my studies, I have a keen interest in entrepreneurship, law, and golf course turf management.
