Howdy! My name is London Chamberlain, and I'm an undergraduate at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), majoring in Economics with applications in Finance and Computer Science. 

I create interactive financial models and [dashboards](https://chamberlainlondon.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/) for businesses using tools like Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Microsoft Power BI, and Python. I have additinoal experience using SQL, R, and Tableau in various academic projects, and I'm always sharpening my skills.

**Note:** I am actively seeking a summer 2024 internship or research position, ideally starting between May and June 2024, in fields related to finance, data science, consulting, or statistics. Please feel free to [contact me](https://chamberlainlondon.github.io/contact/) if you have an opening that aligns with these criteria. I am open to temporary relocation for the position.
