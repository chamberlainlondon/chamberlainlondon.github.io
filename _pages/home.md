Howdy! I'm a first-generation undergraduate studying Economics with applications in Computer Science and Finance at The University of Texas at Austin. Additionally, I'm passionate about data analysis and visualization, entrepreneurship, and law.

In business settings, I have experience creating interactive financial models and dashboards using tools like Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Power BI, and Python. I am also familiar with SQL, R, and Tableau.
