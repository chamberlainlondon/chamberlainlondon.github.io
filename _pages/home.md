Howdy! My name is London and I'm a student at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I study Economics with minors in finance, wealth management, and computer science. 

<h2>Work</h2>
I analyze company data at [The Fox Alliance Wealth Advisors](https://foxalliancewealth.com). You can check out our website at [this link](https://foxalliancewealth.com), or read about some of my projects at [this link](https://londonchamberlain.com/portfolio/). I currently hold my Series 7 securities registration with LPL Financial.

Before finance, I was a golf course groundskeeper for the PGA at Omni Hotels and Resorts, Barton Creek. 

Outside of academics and work, I'm currently interested in securities law, the [money stuff](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/money-stuff-the-podcast/id1739582836) podcast, trail running, and true crime novels.
