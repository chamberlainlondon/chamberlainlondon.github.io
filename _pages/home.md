Howdy! My name is London Chamberlain, and I'm an undergraduate at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), majoring in Economics with applications in Finance and Computer Science. 

I create interactive financial models and [dashboards](https://chamberlainlondon.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/) for businesses using tools like Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Microsoft Power BI, and Python. I have additinoal experience using SQL, R, and Tableau in various academic projects, and I'm always sharpening my skills.

Beyond my studies, I have a keen interest in financial analysis, [trail running](http://edsresults.com/txsb22/reports.php?search_type=race_results&event=Marathon&division=Age+Group), true crime novels, 35mm film photography (specifically landscapes), and serving my community alongside my fellow [Texas Blazers](https://www.texasblazers.com/).
