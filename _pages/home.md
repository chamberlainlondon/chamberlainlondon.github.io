Howdy, my name is London Chamberlain. I'm a current undergraduate at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), majoring in Economics with applications in Computer Science and Finance. 

I specialize in creating interactive financial models and [dashboards](https://chamberlainlondon.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/) for businesses using tools like Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Microsoft Power BI, and Python. I have additinoal experience using SQL, R, and Tableau in various academic projects, and I consistently sharpen my skills.

Beyond my studies, I have a keen interest in financial analysis, [trail running](http://edsresults.com/txsb22/reports.php?search_type=race_results&event=Marathon&division=Age+Group), true crime novels, and 35mm film photography (specifically landscapes).
