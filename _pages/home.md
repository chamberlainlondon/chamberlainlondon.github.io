Howdy! My name is London and I'm an undergraduate student at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I am pursuing a degree in economics, supported by minors in finance and computer science.

I am an Analyst at The Fox Alliance Wealth Advisors; you can check out our website using [this link](https://www.thefoxalliance.com/), or read about select work and personal projects [here](https://londonchamberlain.com/portfolio/). I have held my Series 7 and Series 66 securities registrations with LPL Financial since 2024.

Before working in finance, I was a golf course groundskeeper for the Professional Golfer's Association at Omni Hotels and Resorts, Barton Creek. In my personal time, I'm interested in long-distance running, securities law, the [money stuff](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/money-stuff-the-podcast/id1739582836) podcast, econometrics, and data science.
