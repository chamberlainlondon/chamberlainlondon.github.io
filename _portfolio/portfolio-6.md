In February 2025, I partnered with five undergraduate colleagues in finance, management, and economics to compete in the University of Texas Real Estate Center's Spring Undergraduate Case Competition. 

{% include gallery caption="Executive Summary and Investment Recommendation" %}

Our team, named Forty Acres Capital, analyzed and compared two multifamily real estate investment opportunities in Austin and Denver, presenting an investment recommendation for one property to a panel of four industry experts. To build a robust investment thesis, we projected rent growth and vacancy rates while evaluating long-term market dynamics, demographic trends, and economic conditions. Our recommendation aimed to maximize returns for the Bevo Investment Fund, a fictional pension fund.

Forty Acres Capital placed first, earning a $3,000 cash prize. Our final presentation is linked below.
