At [The Fox Alliance Wealth Advisors](https://www.foxalliancewealth.com/), I developed an internal Power BI dashboard that displays firm assets under management (AUM) and production metrics month-over-month (MoM), utilizing a database of over 224K entries.

### This dashboard displays:

<style>
  blockquote {
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    border-left: 5px solid #31708f;
    margin: 20px 0;
  }
</style>

> - Total firm AUM
> - Percent of total AUM managed by each advisor
> - MoM AUM growth
> - Total firm production
> - Percent of total production by product (investment) category
> - AUM and production correlation by advisor
> - AUM growth over time
> - Production growth over time

This dashboard is updated monthly, maintaining a live connection to ensure it displays the most up-to-date AUM and production information for every advisor in the firm. This project was my first experience using Power BI.
