At The Fox Alliance Wealth Advisors, I developed an internal Power BI dashboard that visualized firm AUM and production metrics, utilizing a database of over 224K entries. The dashboard is updated every month and a live connection to the data ensures that the dashboard displays the most up-to-date AUM and production information available for every advisor in the firm.
