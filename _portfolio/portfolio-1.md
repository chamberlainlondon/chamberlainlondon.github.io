Over the course of 3 months, I tracked the initial contact practices of over 30 firms spanning 7 Texas territories to determine various contact data about our firm's competitors. 

Throughout the project, I compiled response data, including how quickly firms reached out, forms of communcation used, content provided, and more. I ultimately formed a report including data-driven recommendations for improvement that I presented to The Fox Alliance's partners. 

Our team began utilizing instant messaging communication upon my recommendation, given the data I provided.
