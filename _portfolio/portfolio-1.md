------
During 3 months of my time as a wealth management intern at [The Fox Alliance Wealth Advisors](https://www.foxalliancewealth.com/), I analyzed the initial contact practices of 30 competing firms (including The Fox Alliance) across 7 Texas territories to gather data on other wealth management firms. I compiled response data, including communication methods, response times, and content. 

Based on this data, I created a report with data-driven recommendations for The Fox Alliance, which I presented to firm's partners. As a result, our firm began using instant messaging communication, following my recommendation.
