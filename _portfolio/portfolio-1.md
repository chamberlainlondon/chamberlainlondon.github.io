During 3 months of my time as a wealth management intern at [The Fox Alliance Wealth Advisors](https://www.foxalliancewealth.com/), I analyzed the initial contact practices of 30 firms across 7 Texas territories to gather data on our competitors. I compiled response data, including response times, communication methods, and content. 

Based on this data, I created a report with data-driven recommendations, which I presented to The Fox Alliance's partners. As a result, our team started using instant messaging communication, following my recommendation.
