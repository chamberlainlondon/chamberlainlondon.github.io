At [The Fox Alliance Wealth Advisors](https://foxalliancewealth.com/), I created a Microsoft Excel Model that generates a presentable investment portfolio report using financial advisor input.

This model reduces manual calculations by 100% and allows financial advisors to focus on client needs. It is currently used by every advisor in the company.

# Project Details

## Model Overview

- **User Input:** Financial advisors enter client investment data to model.
- **Calculations:** Model calculates investment portfolio based on data provided by user.
- **Formatting:** Model formats potfolio values into intelligible report that advisors can print and present to clients.
