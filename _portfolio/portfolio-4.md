As a Wealth Management Intern at [The Fox Alliance Wealth Advisors](https://www.foxalliancewealth.com), I developed a Microsoft Excel model that produces polished investment portfolio reports tailored to user (financial advisor) inputs. Every advisor and financial planning assistant presents a physical version of this report in client meetings to help clients understand their proposed holdings.

This model reduces investment proposal generation time by 80% and it is currently employed by every advisor and financial planning assistant at The Fox Alliance.

## Project Overview

### Model Details

- **User Input:** Financial advisors enter client investment inputs to model.
- **Calculations:** Model calculates investment portfolio based on data provided by user.
- **Formatting:** Model formats potfolio values into intelligible report that advisors print and present to clients.
