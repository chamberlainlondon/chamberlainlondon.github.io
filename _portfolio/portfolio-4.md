During the Spring 2024 Semester, I created a Microsoft Excel Model for [The Fox Alliance Wealth Advisors](https://foxalliancewealth.com/) that generates a client-facing investment proposal based on the financial advisor's input.

This model reduces manual calculations by 100% and allows financial advisors to focus on client needs. It is currently used by every advisor in the company.
